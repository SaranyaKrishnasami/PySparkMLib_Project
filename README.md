Machine learning projects leveraging the distributed computing power of PySpark

Machine Learning is a branch of AI where Machines learn from data using algorithms such as linear regression, shrinkage models and tree models. The algorithms learn from the data using inductive learning, learning from specific examples to generalize the learning
The machine learning process includes,
1. Data acquisition
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data Engineering
5. Model Selection - Baseline and Candidate Model
6. Model Training and Building
7. Model Testing
8. Model Deployment
   
Machine Learning - ML Library in PySpark

Supervised Learning - The models / Algorithms are trained on Labeled outputs to learn the patterns. Supervised learning tasks are,
    - Classification ( Binary  / Multi class ) - Algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, 
    - Regression ( Discrete valued labels ) - Algorithms such as Linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic net, Decision trees, Random forest
Unsupervised - Data trained against unlabeled historical data
    - Clustering  ( Segment similar data) - Algorithms such as KNN, K means clustering
